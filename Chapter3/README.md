## What is this chapter about 

In the turn of the current century, the scientific community has legislated regulations and executive mandates at making experimental data openly available and reproducible by other researchers. However, the fact is the amount of data that has been shared has been relatively modest. As a result, there is an inability of biomedical researchers to examine and replicate one another's work, researchers are concerned that the BigData revolution will fizzle if it remains difficult or impossible for scientists to locate their colleagues' experimental datasets online, to learn how the experiments were actually performed, and to replicate one another's work. Chapter 3 analyzes 18,559 samples ranging from 137 studies for the availability of the metadata information shared on original publication and public repositories were examined and the availability of metadata for up to 9 phenotypes, including disease condition, age, sex, organism, ethnicity, country, tissue type, mortality, and clinical severity
