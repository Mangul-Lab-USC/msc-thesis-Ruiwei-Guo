## What is this chapter about
Biomedical research is becoming increasingly computationally intensive, scientists are using code to describe and process data, and summarize their results using effective visualization methods, implying that code availability in a published article is of paramount importance1. Sharing analytical code (here on, referred to as code) used in research, and making a studyâ€™s protocol or pipeline easily discoverable can facilitate computational reproducibility and enhance robustness of biomedical research. Most importantly, secondary analysis, where code is shared along with the data analysis and other researchers can curate, examine and re-analyze the data in ways that further its value help with novel biological discoveries and fostering the efficiency of biomedical research in terms of enable fellow researchers to view data analysis. Chapter 2 analyzes code sharing practices across 480 manuscripts from 8 prominent biomedical journals published between 2016 - 2021.
