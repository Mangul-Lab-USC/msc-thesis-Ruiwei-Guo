## What is this chapter about
Modern data-driven research increasingly depends on quantitative analysis and researchers have recognized the need for sharing research products (i.e. raw data, the metadata accompanying the raw data, and the code of the analysis). To promote transparency and reproducibility in biomedical research, it is not only necessary to publish a full description of the study design, methodology, results, and interpretation, but it is also critical to make all research products publicly available, shareable, repurposable, and properly documented. Currently, the conduct of sharing research products relies heavily on individual researchers, and the regulations of data sharing are enforced by these individuals and research institutions in a variety of ways. However, a rising body of evidence in recent years reveals reproducibility issues across many scientific disciplines, i.e. published results frequently contain studies that cannot be reproduced due to a lack of documentation, code, data or metadata. Our study has analyzed 480 publications across eight journals from 2016 to 2021 to quantify code and data availability of the publications and assess the completeness of the metadata reported in publications and online repositories across 127 studies over 18,559 samples across six therapeutic fields. This chapter is all about data availability.
