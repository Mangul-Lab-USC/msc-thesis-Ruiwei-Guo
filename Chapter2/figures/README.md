## Figure 6 
As it is described in chapter 1, 12,603 publications published from the year of 2016 to 2021 from 8 biomedical journals were obtained from PubMed Central. And there were 10 articles selected from each of the 8 journals from the year of 2016 to 2021. In figure 1, it is demonstrated that 31% of the chosen 480 articles have code availability while 69% of the chosen articles were not available and dominate the result. The code and analyzed results are shared in repositories and this finding can be found in figure 6. It presents the code repositories that the 8 journalsused Github has the largest proportion among other code repositories and followed by Zenodo. The proportion of Bitbucket, supplementary code is similar. Regarding the FAIR guiding proposals, the requirement of code is to be finadable and accessible to reuse. In this study, codes are considered to be easy to find if the manuscript includes a code statement.  According to the analysis of code and data availability, code availability is much less reachable than in data availability. 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) which is 40.21% and followed by theSequence Read Archive (SRA) which is 11.34%. Other repositories and webpages constituted 48.45%14. Further, 32.83% of the articles that shared raw data, also had a data availability statement mentioned in the manuscript.
## Figure 7
In order to demonstrate the differences in availability of code occur, the influences of journals mandate on code sharing, policies enforced among the chosen 8 journals. In figure 7, it can be clearly seen that the Bioinformatics journal has the highest standards of code sharing among the 8 journals, and followed by Nature Methods, Nature Genomics and BMC Bioinformatics. 

## Figure 8
In figure 8, it is shown that the trend in data sharing from the year from 2016 to 2021, it can be clearly seen that there is an increase from year to year in code availability. 
In 2016, code sharing was quite moderate, which is only 0.8%, and one year later, the code availability increased to 2.1%. It is not difficult to see that the code availability between 2016 to 2021 is low, compared to data availability. Looking at the figure 8, it is not hard to predict that the availability of data sharing will increase year by year.
